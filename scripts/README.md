# Scripts


This folder contains the scripts used for the extraction, transformation and modelling of genetic data. Apart from standard UNIX operating system tools, it uses the following open source programs:

- EMBOSS infoseq & stretcher [http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl] (required as a dependency to be installed as a command line tool)
- GB2TAB.py, the command line tool behind FeatureExtract [http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/FeatureExtract]  (included in repository)
- Biostrings R Library (part of the BioConductor project) [bioconductor.org].

## Running the scripts

We have provided run-throughs and tutorials for the three main method parts of our manuscript:

- Calculating GC% and transcript length for the relevant genes [README_1_GC_content.md]
- Calculating GARP and FYMINK percentages [README_2_GARP_FYMINK.md]
- Calculating protein overlap percentages with Stretcher Matching [README_3_stretcher.md]
